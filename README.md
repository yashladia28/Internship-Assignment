Merchant Fraud Detection System Using Anomaly Detection Techniques

This repository contains a Merchant Fraud Detection System designed to detect suspicious transaction patterns and flag anomalous behavior based on various features. The system utilizes autoencoders for anomaly detection and implements several rule-based detection techniques to identify high-risk transactions. The goal is to build an automated fraud detection system that can be integrated into transaction processing pipelines for real-time fraud detection.
Key Features:

    Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection: Trains an autoencoder on normal merchant transaction data and identifies outliers based on reconstruction error.
    Fraud Pattern Detection:
        High Velocity Detection: Flags merchants with an unusually high number of transactions within an hour.
        Odd-Hour Pattern Detection: Identifies transactions occurring outside of standard business hours.
        Customer Concentration Risk: Detects merchants with an unusually high concentration of transactions from the same customer, which may indicate fraud.
    Pattern-Specific Scoring: Calculates individual anomaly scores based on velocity, odd-hour, and concentration patterns, and combines them into a final fraud score.

Data Preprocessing:

    Feature Normalization: Features are scaled using Min-Max scaling to ensure consistency in model training.
    Data Transformation: Relevant features such as transaction counts, timestamps, and customer IDs are used for pattern detection.

Technologies Used:

    Python
    TensorFlow for autoencoder implementation
    Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
    Matplotlib for visualization
    Scikit-learn for data preprocessing

How to Use:

    Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
    Prepare your transaction data in a format compatible with the system.
    Train the autoencoder model on normal data and use it to detect anomalies in test data.
    Utilize the pattern detection rules to analyze transaction patterns for fraud detection.

Future Improvements:

    Real-time Fraud Detection: Integrate the system with transaction processing systems for live anomaly detection.
    Advanced Models: Experiment with more sophisticated machine learning models for improved accuracy.
    Scalability: Optimize the system for larger datasets and high-frequency transaction monitoring.
